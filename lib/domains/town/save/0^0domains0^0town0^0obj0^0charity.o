Short "a large bin"
CapName "Charity bin"
ExternalDesc "This a very large bin for holding donations to the needy. Since it is in a church, and for charity, it is reasonable to guess that folks above a certain level will receive a minor bonus for donating valuable things, and a severe penalty for taking them. There is a sign on the charity bin that you can read."
